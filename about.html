    The cases included here are of typically of large size that require significant investment from both parties. These are usually your alleged defective products, medical devices, or pharmaceutical drugs, and because this affects a good chunk of the population the dollar values are high and exposure is plentiful. The defense is usually well guarded with strong council and the battles seem to linger on which can often lead to a test of endurance for all involved. Policy change and nationwide impacts can stem from what happens here in the courts. This makes looking at the numbers interesting, while alone the data presented cannot provide a crystal ball on what the future holds it's worth taking a look at historically how these cases shift and sway.</p>
