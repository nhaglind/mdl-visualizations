<p>There were three MDLs terminated and closed this past month (January 2018 - Februray 2018). That doesn't mean they can't be appealed but they won't be included in the subsequent reports so I wanted to call them out specifically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Mortgage Lending Practices Litigation</li>
  <li>Zoloft (Sertraline Hydrochloride) Products Liability Litigation</li>
  <li>The Honest Company, Inc., Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation</li>
</ul>
